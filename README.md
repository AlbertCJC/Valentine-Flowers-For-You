# 💖 Interactive Valentine's Day Card 💖

This is a fun, interactive, and beautifully animated web application to ask that special someone to be your Valentine. It features a playful card where the "No" button mischievously runs away from the user's cursor, and a "Yes" click triggers a gorgeous procedural flower blooming animation.

## ✨ Features

- **Evasive "No" Button**: The "No" button teleports to a new random position when the user tries to hover over or click it, making it a fun challenge to reject the proposal.
- **Emoji Reactions**: Every few dodges, the "No" button expresses its disappointment with a sad emoji and a message, adding a touch of personality.
- **Beautiful Success Animation**: Clicking "Yes" reveals a stunning, full-screen animation of flowers procedurally blooming in a magical night scene.
- **Responsive Design**: The card and animations look great on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Clean & Modern UI**: A soft, romantic color palette and a clean card design create a delightful user experience.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI components and custom CSS for the complex flower animations.
- **Module Loading**: ES Modules with `importmap` for a modern, build-free development experience.
